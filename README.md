# Awesome papers and blogs on Agent Security


## Overview

This repo aims to study the security and safety threats/risks of the LLM-enabled agents. Note that we do not distinguish between safety and security risks in this paper list. The most common distinction would be that security refers to intentional threats, while safety refers to unintentional threats. But sometimes it may not be that easy to distinguish between intentional and unintentional. So we just mix them together. 

**At a high level, having additional components in the system introduces new attack surfaces to the model as well as new attack targets.** Here, the new attack surface to the model mainly refers to indirect prompt injection attacks that attack the models through other components. New attack targets mean non-model components in the system can be attack targets as well. 



1. Attack the model through other components: (Indirect) prompt injection into the model to disrupt the task of the model
    1. Targeted attack: The goal is to hijack the model to accomplish malicious tasks. The tasks can be any model-level threats discussed:
        1. Generic ones from [LLM safety and security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QowkXo-cM0UQF2FzdSjNkZis9ODeU6AIwucC0nH_vcc/edit?usp=sharing)
    2. Non-targeted attacks: just disrupt the model to not finish the user/benign task (disrupt instruction following)
2. Attack other components through the model: A system calls and executes other components through the model; attackers can give malicious instructions to the model and let the model generate code that exploits components it interacts with.

For  “Attack the model through other components,” without other components, this attack downgrades to directly generating adversarial prompts to attack target LLMs. This is a common risk across all types of agents. For “Attack other components through the model”, without the model, this attack downgrades to traditional software/system security. This risk category is more complex; the risks are different for different types of agents given their different components and goals. In the following, we first summarize common agent types and then discuss the common risks across all agents (attack the model through other components) and specified risks for each type of agent (Attack other components through the model). 

Based on the attack entry points and attack path/targets, we can have 



1. Entry points, i.e., Injection method:
    1. Direct injection: append the adversarial prompts after **the system prompts**
        1. This is realistic when malicious users try to attack an agent by querying it 
        2. If there is a benign user querying the model and the attacker appends an adversarial prompt after the prompt of the benign user, this IMHO is not that realistic. Indirect injection would be more realistic. 
    2. Indirect injection: inject adversarial prompts through other components in the system 
2. Attack targets and goals:
    3. The model:
        3. Non-target attack: mess up with the instructions following the model
        4. Targeted attack: privacy, harmful content generation, etc.
    4. Other components: case-by-case
        5. E.g., Illusioning and goal-misleading in web agents

	

There could be four combinations, where [direct injection + model as the target] downgrade to [LLM safety and security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QowkXo-cM0UQF2FzdSjNkZis9ODeU6AIwucC0nH_vcc/edit?usp=sharing). 

Disclaimer: Please note that while we strive to include a comprehensive selection of papers on the security and safety threats of AI agents, it is not possible to cover all interesting and relevant papers. We will do our best to continually update and expand this document to incorporate more significant contributions in this fast-evolving field. In this document, we discuss the limitations of the included papers. These critiques are not intended to reflect negatively on the authors or the quality of their work. All the papers reviewed here are recognized as valuable contributions to the field. Our aim is to provide constructive analysis to foster further research and understanding.

## Agentic system & benchmarks

A typical agent system is composed of (multiple) LLMs and tools, where LLMs serve as agents to finish a given task, leveraging the available tools. RAG can be considered as one of the simplest agents, where the tool is an external knowledge base. Another simple example of the agent is to connect an LLM with a code interpreter that can execute the code generated by the model. More complex agents involve having multiple collaborative agents, tools, and memory, where each subset of agents controls a different set of tools. Based on their purposes, existing agents can be categorized as web agents that facilitate human-web interactions; coding agents that aid humans in writing code, providing code completion, debugging, etc; and Personal assistant agents that assist users with daily tasks (e.g., setting calendars and sending emails). Note that personal assistant agents can also have web components. Many of the agents involve multiple data modalities.
